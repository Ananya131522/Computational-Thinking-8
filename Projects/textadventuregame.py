#INTRO
print("You're a deep sea diver working on the coast of California.")
print("A full moon shines in the starry abyss, shining a bit of light onto your boat.")
print("You gaze out to the open sea, watching the moon glint on the rolling waves. Oh, right. It's almost time for your dive, you remind yourself.")
print("~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~")

#Choice 1
c1 = input("Do you jump straight into the sea or check your gear first?")
if "jump" or "sea" in c1:
    print("You gaze over the edge of your boat, using a hand to check your air tank. 'All set,' you say. You jump into the sea, water quickly rushing to cover you.")
else:
    print("You turn back to your boat, checking oxygen canisters and navigation equipment. Once you've double- yes, even triple checked, you jump straight into the sea, water rushing to cover you.")

#Part 2
print("As you sink through the depths of the ocean, the light coming from above quickly dims. After a few minutes, you touch down on a outcrop.")
print("You look around, and much to your surprise, a mermaid like elfling creature swims up from the depths to you.")
print("'Wait!' It says, holding its hands up. 'I'm a peace ambassador. Just- you're a diver, right?'")
print("You nod your head.")
print("'Oh- oh, good. Listen, you don't know who I am, but- my people, we need your help.'")
c2 = input("The aquatic elf floats, waiting for your response. Do you [help] him or do you [run away]?")
if "help" in c2:
    print("You can immediately see relief wash over the elf's face as you agree. He quickly reaches out to you, tugging on you gently.")
    print("'Thank you so, so much. Please, come with me.' He says. You eventually relent to his tugs, letting him take you down through the ocean depths.")
    print("As you float through the sea, lights begin to pop up from the lightless void. Much to your surprise, a city lays beneath the waves.")
    print("The aquatic elf leads you to a small hut, adorned by large, glowing pearls. 'This is the most we can provide for you right now. I hope it's enough.' The elf turns to leave, letting you explore the hut. Before he leaves, he turns.")
    print("'My name is Adonis, by the way.'")
    
        c4 = input("You look around in your new...settlement. Due to some enchantment, in this space you can breathe and exist in the sea without a suit. More comfortable, you decide to look around the room. Do you look through the [bookshelf], check the [floorboards}, or check the [bed]?")
        if "book" in c4:
            print("You feel through the books, pulling some out to check titles. By chance, pulling a book happens to open a trapdoor next to your feet. You startle, moving back a bit.")
        elif "floor" in c4
            print("You feel through the floorboards. Some are old, weathered by time, but some are perfect. You decide they must've renovated the place.")
else:
    print("The elf looks...startled. His face twists with emotions, before he settles to a terrifyingly blank face.")
    print("'I'm sorry, I- I didn't want it to come to this.")
    print("The elf lunges forward, leaving you only a slim second to dodge him. Where you just were, he slashes through the water. Terrified, you turn")
