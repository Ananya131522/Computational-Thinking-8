Journaling in my bed. pouring out my deepest longings into my manuscript. There's blankets wrapped around me, and tea in my mouth, as the rain pounds against my window and memories pound against my skull. C.) Reading, falling in love with worlds and people I haven't met yet. People who can't break my heart. Besides, reading will totally help my college applications, so... D.) Standing on the coastline in my best dress, soaked to the bone, laughing at the world. What else is there to do? E.) Journaling about my crush. It may go wrong...but I suppose that's part of the fun isn't it? I listen to rain and dream of him running up to my door and saying the one thing I've been wanting. Love is what makes our lives bright and colorful, and I want to remember this feeling forever.")

So I will be the first choice when I was only an option once upon a time. So I don't have to live for the hope of it all. C.) So I can prove them wrong. So I can beat everyone and they'll realize that I knew everything when I was young. D.) I don't need to become better. No matter how many people tell me I need to change, I know the flaw lies in them, not me. I have given up on the Rhode Island set forever. E.) So I can be proud of myself.
